# Uncomment and edit to add more folders to share. remember to mount the additional volumes to the corresponding path
#$NFS_SHARE $NFS_CLIENT_IP(rw,async,no_root_squash)

# Explanations:
# `$NFS_SHARE` should be the absolute path
# `$NFS_CLIENT_IP` is for the client, could be an absolute IP, a CIDR subnet, or `*` wildcard
# `rw` for read write access, `ro` for read only
# `async` or `sync`
# `no_root_squash` allows client's root to write files with owner root on the server
# another one is `no_all_squash`, so each user on client machine would write files with their own username onto the server
# `fsid=0` to allow client to connect to `$NFS_SERVER_IP:/` instead of `$NFS_SERVER_IP:$NFS_SHARE`. in a way it's more convenient because you don't need to know the `$NFS_SHARE` path
# `no_subtree_check`, `no_auth_nlm`, `insecure` are a couple other options, consult NFS documentations
